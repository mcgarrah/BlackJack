  alert("The way to win the game is to be the closest to 21. This is done by the cards you get. All numbers are worth what number card it is, and each face card is worth 10 points, and finally ace can be worth 1 or 11. Each person gets 2 cards one face up and one face down. You have the ability to see both, but the other players can also see the one card that is flipped over. Once it is your turn you can hit which will give you another card that will be face up or you can stand which will not give you any cards. In the special case when you have two of the same numbers in the cards you have you can split them which will give you two hands. If you want to double down you are forced to get only one hit and you have to double your bet. Every round you have to bet atleast $10 and the maxium is $500. Refresh page if you end up with 0 dollars!");
